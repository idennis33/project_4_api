### Technologies Used 

For the backend I used rails new, rails g scaffold, to help set up my CRUD Routes and allow me to access a database. 

## Aproach Taken 

I decided to set up my schema to know what type of of columns I wanted and to just know what I was trying to setup. 
I also just try to understand what I was trying to do in make sure I seeded,migrated, and install the right packages to make both the back and front end work together. 

## Notes to Self 
As for right now maybe go back and add styling using bootstrap, maybe even adding more data to the players, and getting a show page created with edit and delete button.
